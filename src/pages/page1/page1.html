    All praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds, prayers and peace be upon Muhammad <img src="https://s31.postimg.cc/an5rjj31n/sallallahulong.png" style="height: 16px"> his family, his companiions, and all those
    who follow in his <img src="https://s31.postimg.cc/an5rjj31n/sallallahulong.png" style="height: 16px"> footsteps until the Last Day.

    This book contains some Duas from the Sunnah. Duas which the Prophet <img src="https://s31.postimg.cc/an5rjj31n/sallallahulong.png" style="height: 16px"> used for all times unless stated otherwise. We constantly
    need to be in Dua because we are so helpless. This is very beatifully explained in the commentary that appears in the
    Riyadh us Saliheen Vol. 2 pg. 1086.

    "What is prayer but an expression of one's humbleness and helplessness before Allaah <img src="https://s31.postimg.cc/6fazash1n/subhana.png" style="height: 16px"> The expression of one's weakness, inferiority
    and lowliness before the Infinite Power and Might of Allaah is in fact the essence of worshipping Him. For this reason,
    prayer has been regarded as the essence of worship. Thus prayer is reserved for Him Alone and it should not be adressed
    to anyone else in any case...."
