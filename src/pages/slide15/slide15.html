    O Allaah! Forgive my errors, ignorance, and immoderation in my affairs. You are better aware of my faults than myself. O
    Allaah! Forgive my faults which I committed in seriousness or in fun, deliberately (knowingly) or inadvertently (unknowingly).
    <br>
    <br> O Allaah! Grant me pardon for those sins which I committed in the past and I may commit in the future, which I commited
    in privacy or in public and all those sins of which You are better aware than me. Thou art the First and the Last and
    over all things Thou art Omnipotent.
